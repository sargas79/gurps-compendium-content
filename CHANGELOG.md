# Changelog

## v0.0.1

The first build. The pipeline exists and is proved end to end in Foundry; the
content it carries is six entries, enough to show a description reaching a sheet.

- The books' text is joined to the GWorld system's own compendium entries by id,
  and the merge refuses an orphaned record, a renamed entry, a bad status, an
  empty description, or any record trying to set a statistic.
- Eight packs for the Basic Set — advantages, disadvantages, equipment,
  modifiers, skills, spells, templates and creatures — each a complete copy of
  the system's pack with text added where it has been written. All 2,127
  documents carry the system's statistics unchanged.
- The system's own pack validator runs over the merged result.
- `npm run coverage` reports what is left, per book and per pack.
- A book's rules text compiles to a JournalEntry pack, one entry per rule, with
  the book's page range and the system's rule switch recorded on each. No rules
  are written yet.
- `npm run extract` runs the system's own GCA parsers against another book, and
  refuses to guess when the pinned system's parsers read the Basic Set only.
- The system is a submodule pinned at **gworld v0.18.0**.

Text: Acute Vision, Ambidexterity, Combat Reflexes, Acrobatics, Climbing,
Stealth.
